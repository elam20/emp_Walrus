Ideas on how to compare binSearch and linSearch speed:
- We can, of course, use the currentTimeMillis() to calculate the elapsed time of a method.
- We can also use the number of array accesses or comparisons as a good gauge for algorithm speed. This strategy may be better,
since it does not depend on machine specifications.

Ideas on how to test methods:
- We could hardcode the arrays, but it could be beneficial to use input and output redirection to read in data from a file and output it to a file.
- Perhaps at the start of the program we read in sequences of numbers using nextLine() and store them in an array of arrays. Then, for each array,
we time each of the search algorithms for a variety of inputs. The results for each array are then sent to an output file.

Things to keep in mind:
- Make sure that we are as measuring time passed as accurately as possible (i.e. simple and clean code), measure time immediately before and after code runs.
- Make sure to run many trials with different array sizes.
- Make sure that the arrays that we test with have enough values so that our results are meaningful.
