 Algorithm for counting the number of accesses in a binary search:
 1. Create an array with same size as input array
 2. Fill the array with the number of binary/linear searches to reach that index
 3. Start timer
 4. Binary/lin search
 5. End timer
 6. Find number of array acesses using newly created array
 7. Find elapsed time

EXAMPLE:
A 10 element array:
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Binary search first goes to the middle element, so we set that to 1:
[0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0]
Now we set the midpoints of each half-array to 2:
[0,2,0,0,1,0,0,2,0,0]
Now we set the midpoints of each quarter-array to 3:
[3,2,3,0,1,3,0,2,3,0]
Finally, we set the midpoints of each eighth-array to 4:
[3,2,3,4,1,3,4,2,3,4]
This array will be useful in telling us how many array accesses we need
to get to any particular index via binary search.
